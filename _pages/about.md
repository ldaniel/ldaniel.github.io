## hi, I'm Leandro Daniel

I’m a systems architect, software developer, technical author of articles and speaker in IT events. I’m also an amateur guitar player and podcaster at [Void Podcast](http://voidpodcast.com/). I love my family so much: my wife, my beautiful son and our playful dog. I consider myself a versatile professional with a large IT background and over 20 years of work experience performing different tasks and jobs in software development and architecture. Since 1998 I have been involved with Software Development as a developer, technical leader and architect.

I’ve worked for 8 years at [Emphasys IT Solutions](http://www.emphasys.com.br) as a software developer consultant; helping a significant number of enterprises to deliver their IT software projects with high quality. During this experience, I’ve also coordinated all the teams of developers and managed a Developement and Testing squads, responsible for all developed projects.

In the beginning of 2009 I started to write [technical articles for .NET Magazine](http://leandrodaniel.com/artigo/), a specialized Microsoft based development publication from [DevMedia Group](https://www.devmedia.com.br/perfil/leandro-daniel-1) (the biggest publisher of IT technical articles in Brazil). I focused my articles, mainly, on Design Patterns, SQL Server, Visual Studio and software development techniques. In 2010 I became the Technical Editor of .NET Magazine contributing with my experience to define and select authors and also to revise articles.

I’ve always been involved with IT community, [speaking in many events](http://reverb.leandrodaniel.com/category/Palestras): [DNAD 2009](http://leandrodaniel.com/category/net-architects/), [DNAD 2010](http://leandrodaniel.com/category/net-architects/), [DNAD 2011](http://leandrodaniel.com/category/net-architects/), [DNAD 2012](http://leandrodaniel.com/category/net-architects/), [TDC 2011](http://leandrodaniel.com/category/eventos/), [TDC 2012](http://leandrodaniel.com/category/eventos/) and [QCon 2011](http://leandrodaniel.com/?s=qconsp). 

I've been working as a systems architecture specialist at [Rabobank](http://www.rabobank.com) since mid-2011, one of the world’s most leading, sound and sustainable financial institutions.
