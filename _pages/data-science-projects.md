## data science projects I've developed

Iâ€™m currently working on my Data Science skills and my repositories on <a href="https://github.com/ldaniel?tab=repositories">GitHub</a> are plenty of cool repos.

Following there are some interesting projects:

<ul>
  <li>[https://github.com/ldaniel/fgv-artificial-intelligence-applications](https://github.com/ldaniel/fgv-artificial-intelligence-applications): Practicing Deep Learning in Python applied in the real world.</li>
</ul>
