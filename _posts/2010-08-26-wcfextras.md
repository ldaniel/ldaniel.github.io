Segue uma biblioteca com algumas extensões interessante para o WCF, disponível no [CodePlex](http://wcfextras.codeplex.com/).

> [**WCFExtras**](http://wcfextras.codeplex.com/)
> 
> A collection of useful WCF extensions including Soap Header support, WSDL documentation and more.
> 
> The WCF platform is very extensible and allows you to easily add features that are not part of the core product. This project contains some extensions I needed in a WCF based project:
> 
> - SOAP Header support for WCF
> - Adding WSDL Documentation from Source Code XML Comments
> - Override SOAP Address Location URL
> - Single WSDL file for better compatibility with older SOAP tools.
