Estava procurando alguma ferramenta para testes de unidade com WCF, e a dica me foi dada pelo MVP [Israel Aece](http://www.israelaece.com/) (fera em WCF).

> **[WCF Load Test](http://wcfloadtest.codeplex.com/)**    
> The WCF Load Test for VS 2008 adds support for ASMX web services. Download it from here.
> 
> **Features:**
> 
> - The tool has the following main features:
> - Replay of captured scenario in a unit test that can be included in a load test.
> - Support for the DataContractSerializer.
> - Support for message contracts.
> - ASMX support (beta)
> - Support for proxies generated using svcutil.
> - Support for clients that create proxies at run time from contract interfaces.
> - Supports calls to multiple services in a single scenario.
> - Supports multiple calls to the same service operation.
> - Filtering by SOAP action of which messages in the trace to replay.
> - Readable and modifiable code is generated.
> - Automatic association of trace message with proxy method (requires all operations to have a unique SOAP action).
> - Support for client and server side traces.
> - A command line tool for processing traces and generating code.
> - Visual Studio 2005/2008 integration (Team Developer, Team Test, Team Suite and for 2008 also Professional)) that can be used instead of the command line tool.
