O convite foi realizado hÃ¡ poucos dias por [Grigori Melnik](http://www.gmelnik.com/), um dos coordenadores do projeto, em seu [blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/), e mostra a abertura dos responsÃ¡veis pela Enterprise Library em receber opiniÃµes e sugestÃµes.

Segue o texto original:

> Enterprise Library 5 â€“ whatâ€™s on your wish list?
> 
> Weâ€™ve started our planning of the Enterprise Library 5. This is your chance to send us suggestions, comments, screamsâ€¦ These may include ideas for new blocks, new providers for existing blocks, integration with new .NET Framework 4.0 features, improvements to the design-time experience, performance improvements, support of specific deployment/operations scenarios, documentation/training support etc.
> 
> I am going to use the same technique Tom employed several years ago soliciting feature requests for EntLib3. It seemed to work quite well then. So, imagine you have a sum of money that you can invest in developing EntLib 5. Say $100 (or should I index the amount to be more like a stimulus package? ğŸ™‚ In any case, when suggesting your features, decide how much of that $100 you want to spend for each feature. You can split $100 any way you want. If there is only one feature you want to spend all your money on, you can do it too. Please stay within the budget. Also, be specific â€“ explain your scenario in detail, provide some context, make your case potentially appealing to other users of EntLib. Do remember, however, that EntLib has been and will be a general purpose library of reusable components that are architecture- and application domain-agnostic.
> 
> Once we gather your feedback, we will publish the list of feature requests and invite you to prioritize them.
> 
> Feel free to post your suggestions as comments on my blog or simply email me. Look forward to your propositions!
> 
> Thanks!

Sem dÃºvida eu separaria uma parte dos meus $100 para aprimorar a configuraÃ§Ã£o dos arquivos XML, um pouco para melhorias do Unity Application Block, outro tanto para o Validation Application Block permitir maior integraÃ§Ã£o com outras tecnologias de front end, e o restanteâ€¦ o restante eu guardaria. ğŸ˜‰
